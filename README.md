## Instructions to download video
For each video you want to download:
1. Open the page containing the embedded video.
1. Open development console (Chrome: F12).
1. Go to the Network tab.
1. Right click on the `master.json` request, select Copy â†’ Copy link address. An example of how such a URL could look like: `https://178skyfiregce-a.akamaihd.net/exp=1474107106~acl=%2F142089577%2F%2A~hmac=0d9becc441fc5385462d53bf59cf019c0184690862f49b414e9a2f1c5bafbe0d/142089577/video/426274424,426274425,426274423,426274422/master.json?base64_init=1`.

Create a text file (can be done e. g. by copy-pasting from Google Sheets or Excel), where the first column is output file name (ending with `.mp4`) and the second is this URL to `master.json`.
The format looks like this: <output_filename>TAB<URL_to_master.json>. 
Example file will be added (TODO).

Then run the script, providing the name of this file with names and URLs:
```bash
./vimeo-autio-and-video.py -i names_urls.txt
```
